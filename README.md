- 👋 Hi, I’m Tisa and I'm transitioning from Pastry chef to Data analyst or how I like to put it - From turning raw ingredients into delicious cake to turning raw data into actionable insights! 😁
-     This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics related topics. 
- 📜 I’ve recently finished a Data Analyst Transform course with Academy Xi which was intense with working 50-60 weeks, however I learnt so much especially from my mistakes. Google is my best friend and I'm a troubleshooter ace!
- 📎Here's a link to my <a href="">capstone project </a>
- 🌱 I’m currently learning anything and everything I can to expand my knowledge and experience in Data analytics!
-       🪴Datacamp subscription and currently working on these certifications
-             🌳SQL
-             🌳Tableau
-             🌳Power Bi
